 * and nothing about the host layout engine (the `target` element may come
 * from our own `compile`/`FrameTree`, or a dockview panel's
 * `content.element`; the mechanism is identical).
 *
 * It is the modern, alive replacement for the archived
 * `react-electron-browser-view`: the cross-process bridge that DOM layout
 * libraries (dockview included) deliberately do not provide. dockview's
 * internal `OverlayRenderContainer` does the same getBoundingClientRect →
 * RAF → reposition dance, but its follower is a DOM node; ours is a native
 * `WebContentsView` positioned via the injected `publish`.
