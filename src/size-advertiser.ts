/**
 * Reverse of `createViewAnchor`: runs in a downstream WebContentsView's own
 * renderer, measures the content's own size on ONE owned axis (from the
 * `ResizeObserver` border-box — no `getBoundingClientRect`, no forced reflow),
 * and advertises it via the injected `publish`. Shares the forward primitive's
 * measure/coalesce/dedupe/dispose engine (`createMeasureLoop`).
 *
 * The extent is `Math.round`ed and clamped to `>= 0`; non-finite measurements
 * drop the frame.
 *
 * FOOTGUN — `target` must be shrink-to-fit on the owned axis: its owned-axis
 * size must NOT be driven by the host-applied view size, or the cross-process
 * loop (advertise → host resizes view → remeasure) never converges (it
 * oscillates or stays "stable but wrong"). Measuring `<body>`/`<html>` is the
 * classic mistake — their size *is* the view size. See
 * `docs/bidirectional-design.md`'s single-axis-ownership and trust-boundary
 * sections.
